        Announced on March 1 1999, Sony’s PlayStation 2 was developed throughout the year before allowing select public members to go hands-on with it at the Tokyo Game Show that year. Bigger than the original PlayStation, which had just slimmed down, the PS2 could also be displayed vertically and it boasted a DVD-drive which helped attract consumers from the home entertainment market.
        The console also had connection options to add in a hard drive and was backwards compatible with the PlayStation One library. Sony kept the original controller design in check for the PlayStation 2, making slight tweaks to the input device. Dual Shock was now a standard part of the controller and it now sported a black paint job instead of the PS1 grey scheme
        The PlayStation 2 was released in March of 2000 in Japan, October in North America and November of that year for eager western consumers. Day one sales were phenomenal, with the PS2 pulling in combined sales to the tune of $250 million. Thanks to a massive install base established throughout the world with the PS1 and the backwards compatibility options available, the PS2 sold over 980 000 units in Japan alone in one day
        Disrupting the Dreamcast momentum and effectively killing Sega’s console ambitions, the PS2 also heralded the arrival of two new competitors in the now lucrative gaming market. Nintendo attempted to up their game with a cheaper and more powerful console that lacked home entertainment functions in the form of the GameCube, while Microsoft released their first Xbox which easily had the most powerful hardware of all three.

These new rivals led to Sony cutting the price of their console, as well as a slimmer console that significantly reduced the size and weight of the Sony product
