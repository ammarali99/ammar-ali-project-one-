  <h1 class="ammar">history</h1>       
 <p class="ammar">Sony is one of the world's most widely known electronics companies. Founded in Japan, the company has grown from humble roots to a multinational giant. From the tape player to the Walkman to OLED TV, Sony's tradition of innovation has made it a profitable company for more than 60 years. Kazuo Hirai, who joined the company in 1984 and worked his way up through its media and consumer electronics divisions, became its president and CEO in 2012
    Sony was founded after World War II in 1946 in Tokyo under the name Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corp. by Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita. The company started with less than 200,000 yen--slightly more than $1,500--and began researching. In less than a year, the company released its first product, a power megaphone. In 1950, it released Japan's first tape recorder
    When Sony looked to go global with its products in the mid-1950s, it looked for a new name because the initials TTK were already taken. The company came up with its name by combining the Latin word for sound, "sonus," and the American word "sonny." The company wanted a word that was not found in any language for trademarking reasons. Many within the company questioned the change because of the time spent on making its original name known in the business world, but in 1958, the name was officially changed to Sony Corp. In 1960, Sony launched its U.S. branch. Eight years later, Sony opened a branch in the United Kingdom. The company continued to grow in the 1970s, when it expanded into Spain and France in 1973. German operations were started in 1986
    Sony has a long history of introducing technologies. In 1955, Sony introduced Japan's first transistor radio, the TR-55. Soon after, the company launched a pocket-sized transistor radio. In 1960, Sony released the world's first direct-view portable TV, the TV8-301. The company continued improving the TV and within two years produced the tiniest all-transistor TV. In 1989, Sony released the Handycam, a portable, easy-to-use, 8 mm camcorder. In 2003, the company released the world's first Blu-ray disc player. In 2005, Sony upgraded the Handycam to the High Definition Handycam, creating the world's smallest video camera
    Arguably Sony's most influential product was the Walkman, first released in 1979. The small, lightweight portable tape player revolutionized the way people listened to music, by making at an individual and personal rather than a shared experience. In 1984, Sony followed that initial success with its release of the Discman, the company's first portable CD player. The company's dominance faded as tapes and CDs gave way to digital music, but the Walkman's influence can be seen in modern mobile devices
    Sony is also a major player in the music and film industries through its Sony Music and Sony Pictures divisions. Sony Music began as a joint venture with American label CBS in 1968, but became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony in 1988. The company acquired filmmaker Columbia Studios in 1989, along with the rights to its back catalogue of movies, making Sony Pictures Entertainment an immediate force in the industry. These two divisions represent more than diversification on Sony's part, forming part of a deliberate corporate strategy. Controlling its own content ensured that Sony's technological innovations would never be thwarted by lack of industry support, as Blu-ray's triumph over the rival HD-DVD format would illustrate
    Rivals Nintendo and Sega resurrected the gaming console market in the late 1980s, after the spectacular crash of early pioneers such as Atari. Seeing the potential for a new contender with deep pockets and superior technological expertise, Sony formed a new division called Sony Computer Entertainment in 1993 to exploit this market niche. Its Playstation line of consoles and their portable counterparts have proven to be reliable moneymakers for the company
    As of March 2013, Sony employed more than $146,000 people worldwide. The company's year-end revenue in March 2014 was over $7.5 billion, with an operating loss for the year of over $1.2 billion U.S.. Much of that loss came from the company's decision to shut down its troubled PC manufacturing operation, as well as lower-than-expected sales of smartphones and ongoing price pressure from lower-cost rivals in its audio and video divisions. Its mobile communications division, gaming division, imaging-products division and Sony Pictures division remain strong, providing the bulk of the company's projected revenue growth for 2015</p>

   <h1 class="ammar">gaming success</h1>
   <p class="ammar">The Sony Corporation managed 2 major feats and hit 1 bird with 2 stones, when it brought to the world the Sony Playstation product line. It managed to take Nintendo's place as supreme games machine, and made realistic 3D games a reality.

        For many years Nintendo was number one with it set of consoles. Nintendo was thought of as the only console manufacturer with a product dedicated to great gaming. However, something amazing happened on the consumer front, and that was talk of Sony about to produce a breakthrough gaming device, soon to be called the PlayStation.
        
        Sony has always been at the forefront of consumer electronics. It is the undisputed king! Sony has given us the Walkman, an invention which has been the inspiration of the iPod. Sony and Philips were the first to create the CD technology we see today. As Nintendo approached Sony for help in creating a CD based console, and they began working together, problems started with contracts. In the end Sony released a product called the Sony PlayStation.
        
        The results were amazing. People from all across the world were waiting for mass release for this amazing gaming device. People would pay extortionate amounts to get one shipped from Japan.
        
        So, what has made the Playstation so popular? We know that Sony is at the forefront of technology innovation. They simply always amaze the world with there new inventions which people long for. The CD technology in the Playstation range of products has enabled the games to hold more information. And bigger space, allows bigger and better games.
        
        The original Sony PlayStation was launched in Japan in 1994, and '95 saw the Sony PlayStation released all across the world. It shared a massive 11 years of availability, and in 2006 Sony stopped the production. However, that was not the end of the Sony Playstation; people just couldn't have enough of the high grade graphics available.
        
        Sony came in with the Sony PlayStation II. A console which when released had exponentially better graphics, and games than the first. The bigger benefit was that it was backward compatible with existing PlayStation 1 games. This made getting the PS2 much more of a bargain.
        
        The PS2 was so powerful that Japan initially imposed export restrictions on the PS2. The PS2 was even said to contain parts, especially its powerful graphics hardware, which could be used to simulate the effects of military ballistic missiles! No wonder it became so popular.
        
        After its release in 2000, the PlayStation 2 only took 5 years to become the fastest selling console in history, selling a whopping 100 million units. In fact when it was released, due to shortages, many were sold on eBay for $1,000+!
        
        The Sony PlayStation has transformed gaming. It took us out of that 80's arcade style games to today's photorealistic 3D games, and worlds which are as big and wide as our Earth! Sony has not stopped there with its great innovation technology. As Microsoft started on the road to creating gaming devices, they released the X Box, Sony made a comeback with the Sony Playstation 3 or PS3. This version contains hardware which makes it as powerful as a PC. Being designed for gaming, it will bring forth games which provide hours and hours of enjoyment with cutting edge graphics, never seen before.</p>
