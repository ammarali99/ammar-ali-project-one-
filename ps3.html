            The console was officially announced at E3 2005, the same year that Microsoft’s Xbox 360 was actually released. It was to use a new type of technology for its processing, a chip so powerful that the unit wouldn’t even need a dedicated graphics processor. The fabled Cell wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, being quite a tricky thing to program for, so Sony added a very nearly off-the-shelf GPU to the PlayStation 3 late in its development. When it was first shown, it had a new shaped of controller, departing from the much-loved DualShock, but fan response got Sony to change its mind, and we ended up with a rumble-less Six-Axis.

            The original version of the console had full backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 and PlayStation games, but it made the system too expensive, so later units removed hardware compatibility, replacing them with software emulation. Later units still removed PS2 backwards compatibility – and secondary operating system support – altogether.
            
            It also featured a brand-new optical disc, the Blu-Ray , that would enable uncompressed graphics and audio, but being such new tech meant the PS3 had a slow drive, so most of its games needed to be installed.
            PlayStation 3 was first released in Japan on November 11, 2006. The initial shipments sold out in Japan and the system seemed to be destined for instant success. But once it hit the rest of the globe, The PlayStation 3 was not as well received as Sony had hoped. It was quite damned expensive, compared to its predecessor.

Even worse – it was expensive when compared to Microsoft’s Xbox, which was cheaper, had a more robust, but paid-for online, service. On top of that, multiplatform games seemed to look and run better on the competition. It really looked like PlayStation was in a spot of bother. But then something changed. Sony released a much cheaper slimmer, PS3. It fixed its online. It focused on exclusive games, and devised the incredible PlayStation Plus service. In the end, the console’s sold around 80 million units to date – around the same as the Xbox, which got a year’s head start.
