            On February 1st 2013, Sony released a teaser for an event in New York on the 20th of February, 2013 for the "Future of PlayStation". This lead to speculation of the reveal of Playstation 4. One week before the event, leaked images of a redesigned DualShock 4 surfaced, featuring a touchpad and audiojack. These pictures were close but not exact to what was shown off. The differences are in the keys, and the overall squareness of the design, in comparison to the smooth circular desgn of the final Dualshock 4. Sony's Playstation 4 has been in developement since 2008, only a couple years after the high priced PS3 release.
            Sony revealed details about the PlayStation 4 however the console wasn't shown at all. They also announced Remote Play with the Vita. See "PlayStation 4 Features" for more details about the features of PlayStation 4.
            At E3, Sony unveiled the look of its console. Andrew House, announced that the PlayStation 4 will launch at a price point of $399, €399 and £349, compared to the Xbox One's launch price of $499, €499 and £429, will be available in "Holiday 2013".

            Andrew House revealed that the PlayStation 4 will be available on November 15th in North America and November 29th in Europe.
